# BayesianParameterEstimation
This code is used to run the Bayesian parameter estimation methods for updating duration-based parameters used in post-earthquake recovery models. The code was written by Morolake Omoya and Henry Burton and the calculations are based on the following paper: Omoya, M, Burton, H. and Baroud, H. (2022). Bayesian parameter estimation of duration-based variables used in post-earthquake building recovery modeling, Earthquake Spectra, DOI: 10.1177/87552930211073717

Four additional files are needed to run this script. Three of them are .csv files (permitTime.csv, repairTime.csv and recoveryTime.csv) and the fourth is the bayesianParameterEstimation.py file which contains the class and methods that support the main script.
